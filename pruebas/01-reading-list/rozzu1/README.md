## Tests ðŸ§ª

This is my first time writing tests, so I'm not sure if they are the best tests. ðŸ˜­
The project includes a set of tests for the `bookStore` states managements module to ensure its functionality. These tests are written using the `vitest` testing framework.

### Test Descriptions

- **should add book to the reading list**: This test verifies that a book can be successfully added to the reading list. It initializes the `readingList` with some initial books, adds a new book using the `addBook` method, and checks if the updated reading list contains the new book along with the initial books.

- **should remove a book from the reading list**: This test validates the ability to remove a book from the reading list. It sets up an initial `readingList` with multiple books, selects a book to remove, uses the `removeBook` method to remove it, and verifies that the book is no longer present in the updated reading list.

- **should set the selected genre**: This test ensures that the selected genre can be correctly set using the `setSelectedGenre` method. It sets the selected genre to "Fiction" and checks if the `selectedGenre` state matches the expected value.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can execute the following command:

```shell
npm run test

```
