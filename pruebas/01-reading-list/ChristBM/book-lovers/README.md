# Book-Lovers

It is a simple Next.js 13 application with TypeScript created to solve [the technical test #1](https://github.com/midudev/pruebas-tecnicas) of the page [https://pruebastecnicas.com/](https://pruebastecnicas.com/)

Note:
- The environment variable used is in the .env.example file, and you only need to rename the file to .env.local

- In a more serious project, this variable should not be in the repository.
