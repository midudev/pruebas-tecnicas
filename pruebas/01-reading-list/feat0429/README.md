### 📝 The application requirements are the following:

    ✔ The application shows a list of available books that the user can check.
    
    ✔ The user is able to create a reading list from the available books. It should be clear when a book has been added to the reading list and when it is not. It should be possible to move a book from the reading list to the list of available books.
    
    ✔ Users should be able to filter the list of available books by genre. Besides, there should be a counter to display the number of available books, books in the reading list and the available books of the selected genre. 
    
    ✔ There should be a synchronization of the global state to display the number of books in the reading list and the available books that are still available. If a book is moved from the available books list to the reading list, both counters should be updated respectively.
    
    ✔ Reading list data should be persisted in the browser's localStorage. After reloading the page, the reading list shoud persist.
