This proyect is **technical test** from [miduDev](https://www.youtube.com/@midudev). I use only vanilla js because in this moment I don't know any framework.


## This are the TODO's

### Functionality

- [x] **Display of Available Books**: The application must display a list of available books that the user can review.
- [x] **Creating Reading List**: The user must be able to create a reading list from the available books. It should be clear from the UI which books are on the reading list and which are not. It should also be possible to move a book from the reading list to the available list.

- [x] **Filtering Books by Genre**: Users should be able to filter the list of available books by genre, and a counter will be displayed with the number of books available, the number of books in the reading list, and the number of books available in the selected genre.
- [x] **State Sync**: There should be a global status sync that reflects the number of books on the reading list and the number of books still available. If a book is moved from the available list to the reading list, the count for both should be updated accordingly.
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: The application must persist reading list data in the browser's local storage. When reloading the page, the reading list should be maintained.
- [ ] **Synchronization between tabs**: If the user opens the application in two different tabs, the changes made in one tab should be reflected in the other. No need to use Backend.
- [x] **Deployment**: The application must be deployed on a free hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, etc) and must be accessible through a public URL. Indicate the URL in the README.
- [ ] **Test**: The application must have AT LEAST one test. Do the test that you consider most important for your application.


## Additional challenges

- [ ] Implement a search functionality in the list of available books.
- [ ] Add a new filter to filter books by number of pages.
- [ ] Allow rearranging of books in the reading list by priority.
- [ ] Add a functionality to save the reading list in the browser's local storage for later retrieval.
- [x] Make your design responsive.
