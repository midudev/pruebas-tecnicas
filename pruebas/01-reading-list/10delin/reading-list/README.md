## Interest

The application has an automated commitlint with Husky. Here is an example syntax for more details:

```
$ git commit -m "feat(app): explain commitlint in readme"
```

The syntax must be the same as the example, even with spaces. Only the content of "feat" , "app" scope and explication code should be changed.
